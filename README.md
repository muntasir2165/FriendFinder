# FriendFinder
A Node.js Compatibility-based "FriendFinder" Application

## Project Motivation

This app was developed as part of the Express.js homework assignment at the University of Toronto Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. This project is a testament to the mastery of advanced Node.js concepts that include client-server interaction and MySQL relational database query execution which ultimately resulted in a practical app that is simple yet powerful in its features and functionality.

## Environment Setup
Download and Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on you computer.
Please note that this app was developed using Node v8.11.4.

## Getting Started

1) Either download the zipped project from GitHub or clone the repo into your local machine.  
The rest of the steps need to be executed on the Terminal:  
2) Cd into the directory FriendFinder.
3) To install all the dependency packages in the project locally, run: `npm install`
4) To run the app, execute: `node server` or `node server.js` or `npm run-script start`
